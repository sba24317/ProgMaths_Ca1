## Getting Started

This project was creaed by using VsCode ;) I Prefer always using VSCode

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
